# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! ðŸŽ‰

I've been thinking about starting a blog for a while now... and I've finally gotten around to setting one up. I'm excited to have somewhere to share my thoughts and experiences more publicly.

<!-- more -->

## What to Expect

This blog will be a mix of:

- **Technical posts** - Code solutions, architecture decisions, tools I'm exploring
- **Learning experiences** - Both successes and failures (especially failures!)
- **Project updates** - Things I'm building, experimenting with, or contributing to
- **Reflections** - Thoughts on the industry, career growth, and life as a developer

Really, I'm a big fan of [Simon Willison's Blog](https://simonwillison.net/), and really like his style of sometimes small, sometimes larger posts on all sorts of topic.

## The Tech Behind This Blog

Since this is a developer blog, I figure I should mention the stack! I'm using:

- **MkDocs Material** - Because I love how clean and functional it is
- **GitHub Pages** - Simple, free, and integrates perfectly with my workflow
- **GitHub Actions** - For automated builds and deployments

The whole thing is open source, so if you're curious about how anything works, you can check out the [repository](https://github.com/michaeltinsley/michaeltinsley.github.io). Honestly the CSS means nothing to me, so thanks to Claude for that :shrug:.
